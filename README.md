PALENIGHT EVERYTHING
====================
This is a repo where i customize my favorite programs with the material palenight color scheme.
If the colorscheme exists naviely, eg. jetbrains ide and vscode i suggest using the built in colorscheme verions, or "official" the plugins.

The programs include:
	* i3-gaps
	* radare2
	* vim
	* neovim
	* gnome-terminal

Aknowlegements:
	* The original creators of the palenight theme.

Notes:
	* I am not the original creator of the palenight theme.
